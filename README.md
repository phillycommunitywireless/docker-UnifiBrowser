# PCW Specific Stuff

## Setup

1. Install docker, git clone the repo
2. Set the UNIFI_PASS env variable to be equal to the password for the apibrowser user for the unifi controller interface. (if the password is "bob", run `export UNIFI_PASS=bob`)
3. Run `docker compose up`
4. Navigate to https://apibrowser.phillycommunitywireless.org/# and log in.

## Setting a login password

To set a login password you have to pick your password, then hash it using sha512, then get the hexdigest of the password. In python 3:

```
import hashlib
password = "password_text".encode()
m = hashlib.sha512()
m.update(password)

# This will return your final value
m.hexdigest()
```

Paste the result into the APIBROWSERPASS value in the unifiapibrowser service in docker-compose.yml




# Unifi-API-Browser v2.0.23

 Docker for unifi browser <https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-browser>

Includes support for UniFiOS on UDMP - see note on ports

 The API Browser lets you pull raw, JSON formatted data from the API running on your controller.

## Required Environment Variables
 To run this container you will need to define the following variables:

| Environment Variable | Default                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USER                 | Your unifi username         | Your username on unifi console - consider creating a restricted user                                                                           |
| PASSWORD             | Your unifi password         | clear text unifi password                                                                                                                      |
| UNIFIURL             | https://192.168.1.1         | URL to your controller *without* the port or trailing / on the URL                                                                                                      |
| PORT                 | 443                        | Port if you changed the port unifi is running on - default env var setting 443 is now the default for UDM / UDMP for older UniFiOS based controllers change to 8443 controllers                                                                                               |
| DISPLAYNAME          | My Site Name                | Arbitrary name you want to refer to this site as in API Browser                                                                                |
| NOAPIBROWSERAUTH     | 0                           | use to disable browser auth
| APIBROWSERUSER       | admin                       | username to secure the API Browser instance                                                                                                    |
| APIBROWSERPASS       | see note | Note: Generate a SHA512 of the password you want and put here, you can use a tool like https://abunchofutils.com/u/computing/sha512-hash-calculator/ by default the password is 'admin' i.e. c7ad44cbad762a5da0a452f9e854fdc1e0e7a52a38015f23f3eab1d80b931dd472634dfac71cd34ebc35d16ab7fb8a90c81f975113d6c7538dc69dd8de9077ec|

## Getting Running
To get started this is the minimum number of options, be sure to append each envar with the required text (esp the SHA512):

`docker run --name unifiapibrowser -p:8000:8000 -e USER= -e PASSWORD= -e UNIFIURL= -e APIBROWSERPASS=    scyto/unifibrowser`

This will run the container on host port 8000/tcp.

## Using Docker Compose / Stack

This is the fastest way to get running for unifios and doesn't require the use of the hash
```
version: '3.8'
services:
  unifiapibrowser:
    ports:
    - 8010:8000
    environment:
      USER: unifi console local account 
      PASSWORD: unifi console password
      NOAPIBROWSERAUTH: 1 # disables auth to apibrowser
      UNIFIURL: https://192.168.1.1
      PORT: 443
      DISPLAYNAME: Home
    image: scyto/unifibrowser
 ```   

## Using Multiple Unifi Controllers

Unifi-API-Browser supports multiple controllers.  To use them copy the users.php and config.php into a host directory and the map them into the container with the additional following command line options:

`-v <YourHostPath>/config.php:/UniFi-API-browser/config/config.php` 

and

`-v <YourHostPath>/config.php:/UniFi-API-browser/config/users.php`

Editing these files is beyond the scope of this readme.md but both contain good instructions
